This is my portfolio for Data Analysis. Here is a description of each project I have done so far!



Covid Data Exploration: In this project, I analyzed COVID-19 data from different countries and dates using SQL. I had to clean the data in Excel first, and then imported it into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studios. From there I did data exploration and found the amount of infected people who die in the United States, countries with the highest death rates, and what percentage of the population has been vaccinated. 
The data was found at https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.



Correlation with Movies: In this project, I used Python to analyze data from https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies. 
I tried to find out which categories had the most impact on overall revenue using scatter plots and correlation matrices. 

Music Artists Data Cleaning: In this project, I used NumPy and Pandas to clean a data frame. I combined two columns, dropped unnecessary columns, dropped duplicate columns, and renamed the columns. The data was found at https://www.kaggle.com/pieca111/music-artists-popularity
